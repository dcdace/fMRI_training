    "`Bash` is a `Unix shell` and command language. A `Unix shell` is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems (e.g., `Linux`, `macOS`). `Bash` is readily available on `Linux` and `macOS` systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many tutorials available online. For example, [this Shell Scripting Tutorial](https://www.shellscript.sh/). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "<img align=\"right\" src=\"https://logos-world.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Python-Symbol-700x394.png\" width=\"14%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Python` is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is license-free, unlike, for example, Matlab. That's one of the reasons why `Python` is nowadays a recommended choice for reproducible & open code. \n",
    "\n",
    "`High-level` means that it is 'easy' for humans (scientists) to work with. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to install `Python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method that many people use, is to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#Downloads) to install `Python` and various important `Python` libraries. Anaconda is a particularly good option for Windows, because Windows is a relatively complicated platform for building code, such as Python and its libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "But at least to start with, it would be good enough to install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), which takes up much less resources. \n",
    "<img align=\"right\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Matlab_Logo.png\" width=\"8%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matlab\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have it available, `Matlab` still provides loads of useful resources for Neuroimaging analysis. \n",

    "\n",
    "<img align=\"right\" src=\"https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/visualstudio_code/visualstudio_code-ar21.svg\" width=\"16%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend using [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to write, edit, manage and run your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "With `VSCode` you can also access a remote computing environement, like CBU compute nodes or High Performance Computing (HPC) environement. Here is a blog on [how to use VSCode to access HPC](https://blog.wytamma.com/blog/hcp-vscode/). A similar approach would be for any other SSH connection, like connecting to CBU computing environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code - your analysis code. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "See an introductory tutorial on `Git` and `GitHub` [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsmt2rHPJDU). \n",

    "`Jupyter Notebook` is a very useful tool for integrating your notes and code and output in a web-based notebook like this. The Jupyter system supports over 100 programming languages (called “kernels” in the Jupyter ecosystem) including `Python` and `R`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Jupyter Notebook` is one way to run (relatively simple) `Python` commands. It is a particularly good way of running code for beginners, because it gets you started very quickly, in a familiar interface (the web browser). However, it is not a good interface for writing more than a small amount of code. It's really more a 'notebook'.\n",

    "`Conda` is an open-source, cross-platform, language-agnostic package manager and environment management system. The Conda package and environment manager is included in all versions of `Anaconda` and `Miniconda`. \n",
    "\n",
    "With `conda`, you can create, export, list, remove, and update environments that have different versions of `Python` and/or packages installed in them. You can, for example, create your fMRI analysis environment that includes packages needed for your analysis work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are instructions on [managing `conda` environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "I have shared with you the environment that you'd need to do the things we will do in this workshop. It is available on the [GitHub workshop materials page](https://github.com/dcdace/COGNESTIC-fMRI) as a file `environment.yml`.  \n",
