    "\n",
    "`fMRIprep` ([A Robust Preprocessing Pipeline for fMRI Data](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/) is another [BIDS-App](https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/). \n",
    "\n",
    "fMRIPrep is a fMRI data preprocessing pipeline that is designed to provide an easily accessible, state-of-the-art interface that is robust to variations in scan acquisition protocols and that requires **minimal user input**, while providing easily interpretable and comprehensive error and output reporting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fMRIPrep pipeline uses a combination of tools from well-known software packages, including FSL, ANTs, FreeSurfer and AFNI. This pipeline was designed to **provide the best software implementation for each state of preprocessing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "fMRIPrep performs **minimal preprocessing**: motion correction, field unwarping, normalization, bias field correction, and brain extraction. [See the workflows section of our documentation for more details](https://fmriprep.org/en/latest/workflows.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "fMRIPrep adapts its pipeline depending on what data and metadata are available and are used as the input. For example, slice timing correction will be performed only if the `SliceTiming` metadata field is found for the input dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing of structural MRI\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps: \n",
    "* Brain extraction (skull-stripping; helps with normalisation), \n",
    "* brain tissue segmentation (needed for normalisation) and \n",
    "* spatial normalisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lesion masking during normalisation\n",
    "\n",
    "When processing images from patients with focal brain lesions (e.g., stroke, tumor resection), it is possible to provide a lesion mask to be used during spatial normalization to standard space. The mask will be used to minimize warping of healthy tissue into damaged areas (or vice-versa). Lesion masks should be binary NIfTI images (damaged areas = 1, everywhere else = 0) in the same space and resolution as the T1 image, and follow the naming convention specified in [BIDS Extension Proposal 3: Common Derivatives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wwc4A6Mow4ZPPszDIWfCUCRNstn7d_zzaWPcfcHmgI4/edit#heading=h.9146wuepclkt) (e.g., `sub-001_T1w_label-lesion_roi.nii.gz`). This file should be placed in the `sub-*/anat` directory of the BIDS dataset to be run through fMRIPrep. Because lesion masks are not currently part of the BIDS specification, it is also necessary to include a `.bidsignore` file in the root of your dataset directory. This will prevent bids-validator from complaining that your dataset is not valid BIDS, which prevents fMRIPrep from running. Your `.bidsignore` file should include the following line: `*lesion_roi.nii.gz`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Surface preprocessing\n",
    "fMRIPrep uses [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) to reconstruct surfaces from T1w/T2w structural images. If enabled, several steps in the fMRIPrep pipeline are added or replaced. All surface preprocessing may be disabled with the `--fs-no-reconall` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BOLD preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### BOLD reference image estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference image is used to calculate a brain mask for the BOLD signal, estimate head-motion, and register BOLD to T1w.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If a single-band reference (“sbref”) image associated with the BOLD series is available, then it is used directly. If not, a reference image is estimated from the BOLD series as follows: When T1-saturation effects (“dummy scans” or non-steady state volumes) are detected, they are averaged and used as reference due to their superior tissue contrast. Otherwise, a median of motion corrected subset of volumes is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Head-motion estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the previously estimated reference scan, FSL `mcflirt` is used to estimate head-motion. For a more accurate estimation of head-motion, the motion parameters are calculated before any time-domain filtering (i.e., slice-timing correction).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Slice time correction\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `SliceTiming` field is available within the input dataset metadata, this workflow performs slice time correction prior to other signal resampling processes. Slice time correction is performed using AFNI `3dTShift`. All slices are realigned in time to the **middle of each TR**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slice time correction can be disabled with the `--ignore slicetiming` command line argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Susceptibility Distortion Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major problems that affects EPI data is the spatial distortion caused by the inhomogeneity of the field inside the scanner. This step applies susceptibility-derived distortion correction, based on fieldmap estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pre-processed BOLD in native space\n",
    "\n",
    "A new *preproc* BOLD series is generated from the slice-timing corrected (or the original) data in the original space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EPI to T1w registration\n",
    "\n",
    "The alignment between the reference EPI image of each run and the reconstructed subject using the gray/white matter boundary is calculated by the `bbregister` routine. If FreeSurfer processing is disabled, FSL `flirt` is run with the BBR cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resampling BOLD runs to standard spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "EPI image is mapped to the standard spaces given by the `--output-spaces` argument (see [Defining standard and nonstandard spaces where data will be resampled](https://fmriprep.org/en/latest/spaces.html#output-spaces)).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EPI sampled to FreeSurfer surfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "If FreeSurfer processing is enabled, the motion-corrected functional series (after single shot resampling to T1w space) is sampled to the surface by averaging across the cortical ribbon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surfaces are generated for the “subject native” surface, as well as transformed to the `fsaverage` template space. All surface outputs are in GIFTI format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confounds estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-neuronal fluctuations in fMRI data may appear as a result of head motion, scanner noise, or physiological fluctuations (related to cardiac or respiratory effects). For a detailed review of the possible sources of noise in the BOLD signal, see [Greve et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11336-012-9294-0). \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a motion-corrected fMRI, a brain mask, movement parameters and a segmentation, potential confounds per volume (time-point) are calculated. Confounding variables calculated in fMRIPrep are stored separately for each subject, session and run in `.tsv` files - one column for each confound variable. Such tabular files may include over 100 columns of potential confound regressors.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to minimize confounding effects of non-neuronal signals by including them as nuisance regressors in the GLM design matrix. The fMRIPrep pipeline generates a large array of possible confounds. The most well established confounding variables in neuroimaging are the six head-motion parameters (three rotations and three translations) - the common output of the head-motion correction (also known as realignment) of popular fMRI preprocessing software such as SPM or FSL. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not include all columns of `~_desc-confounds_timeseries.tsv` table into your design matrix! Filter the table first, to include only the confounds you want to remove from your fMRI signal.** [See the fMRIPrep confound regressor description](https://fmriprep.org/en/latest/outputs.html#confound-regressors-description). \n"
