    "`Bash` is a `Unix shell` and command language. A `Unix shell` is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems (e.g., `Linux`, `macOS`). `Bash` is readily available on `Linux` and `macOS` systems. \n",

    "There are several ways to install `Python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method that some people use, is to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#Downloads) that comes with `Python` and `Conda` package manager and hundreds of packages and libraries. However,  my recommendation is to install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). **Miniconda** is a minimalistic version of Anaconda. It comes with the `Conda` package manager and `Python`, but it does not include any pre-installed packages besides the few necessary to run `Conda`. Users can then install only the packages they need using `Conda`. Miniconda provides more control over the environment, as users can create tailored environments with only the packages they need for a specific project. It also takes up much less resources compared to Anaconda. \n",
