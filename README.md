# fMRI training materials
Preliminary fMRI training materials (work in progress). 

## Interactive notebooks
[MyBinder.org ](https://mybinder.org) is a service that allows you to run Jupyter notebooks directly online. However, this service comes with a restricted computational environment (1-2GB of RAM). This means, many notebooks might be very slow and some might even crash, due to not enough memory.

You can use this approach to run and test most of the notebooks. To access the MyBinder instance, click on the badhe below.

## Static notebooks
You can also view the notebooks with all solutions provided just clicking on them in the *'notebooks'* directory. 

## Download the notebooks and run on your computer
You can also download the notebooks and run on your computer. For that you will need to have Jupyter notebooks set up. The python libraries required for the notebooks are included in the `requirements.txt` file.
